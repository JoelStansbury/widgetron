# CONSTRUCTOR_PARAMS
company:
    flag: "-company"
    help: |
        Name of the company/entity who is responsible for the installer.

installer_filename:
    flag: "-installer_filename"
    help: |
        The filename of the installer being created. If not supplied, a reasonable
        default will determined by the name, version, platform, and installer type.
        https://github.com/conda/constructor/blob/main/CONSTRUCT.md#installer_filename

installer_type:
    flag: "-installer_type"
    help: |
        The type of the installer being created. Possible values are:
            - sh: shell-based installer for Linux or macOS;
            - pkg: macOS GUI installer built with Apple's pkgbuild
            - exe: Windows GUI installer built with NSIS
        The default type is sh on Linux and macOS, and exe on Windows.
        A special value of all builds both sh and pkg installers on macOS,
        as well as sh on Linux and exe on Windows.

license_file:
    flag: "-license_file"
    help: |
        Path to the license file being displayed by the installer during the install process.
        It must be plain text (.txt) for shell-based installers. On PKG, .txt, .rtf and 
        .html are supported. On Windows, .txt and .rtf are supported.

batch_mode:
    flag: "-batch_mode"
    help: |
        Only affects .sh installers. If False (default), the installer launches
        an interactive wizard guiding the user through the available options.
        If True, the installer runs automatically as if -b was passed.

signing_identity_name:
    flag: "-signing_identity_name"
    help: |
        By default, the MacOS pkg installer isn't signed. If an identity name is
        specified using this option, it will be used to sign the installer with
        Apple's productsign. Note that you will need to have a certificate
        (usually an "Installer certificate") and the corresponding private key,
        together called an 'identity', in one of your accessible keychains.
        Common values for this option follow this format 
            Developer ID Installer: Name of the owner (XXXXXX)

welcome_image:
    flag: "-welcome_image"
    help: |
        Path to an image in any common image format (.png, .jpg, .tif, etc.) to 
        be used as the welcome image for the Windows installer. The image is

    flag: "-header_image"
    help: |

default_image_color:
    flag: "-default_image_color"
    help: |
        The color of the default images (when not providing explicit image files) 
        used on Windows. Possible values are red, green, blue, yellow. The default is blue.
    
welcome_image_text:
    flag: "-welcome_image_text"
    help: |
        If welcome_image is not provided, use this text when generating the image
        (Windows only). Defaults to name.

header_image_text:
    flag: "-header_image_text"
    help: |
        If header_image is not provided, use this text when generating the image
        (Windows only). Defaults to name.

nsis_template:
    flag: "-nsis_template"
    help: |
        If nsis_template is not provided, constructor uses its default NSIS template.
        For more complete customization for the installation experience, provide
        an NSIS template file. (Windows only)

default_prefix:
    flag: "-default_prefix"
    help: |
        You probably want to use default_prefix_domain_user instead.
        The following description from the constructor repo does not reflect the
        actual behavior, in that, selecting "Just Me" does not populate the install
        location with the string provided here. I'm not sure what exactly it does.

        Set default install prefix. On Linux, if not provided, the default prefix
        is ${HOME}/${NAME}. On windows, this is used only for "Just Me" installation;
        for "All Users" installation, use the default_prefix_all_users key.
        If not provided, the default prefix is ${USERPROFILE}\${NAME}.

default_prefix_domain_user:
    flag: "-default_prefix_domain_user"
    help: |
        Set default installation prefix for domain user. If not provided, the
        installation prefix for domain user will be ${LOCALAPPDATA}\${NAME}.
        By default, it is different from the default_prefix value to avoid
        installing the distribution in the roaming profile. Windows only.

default_prefix_all_users:
    flag: "-default_prefix_all_users"
    help: |
        You probably want to use default_prefix_domain_user instead.
        I would not recomend advising users to install your app for "All Users"
        as this is not tested, but that is the senario in which this parameter
        is used (i.e. when the app is being installed for all users).

        Set default installation prefix for All Users installation.
        If not provided, the installation prefix for all users installation
        will be ${ALLUSERSPROFILE}\${NAME}. Windows only.
