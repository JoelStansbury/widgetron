    # consturctor will ignore this section because it is being installed from
    # the "local" channel. Not sure what the reasoning behind that is, but
    # there is no point in adding stuff here... It will just make the build
    # process take longer. But normally this section would be where the runtime
    # dependencies are placed.
    # This section is also used during the `test` section, where you'd normally
    # at least try to import the library. Again, it'd be a waste of time for the
    # widgetron process.
