widgetron
=========

App bundler for ipython notebooks. This command line utility builds a
standalone executable installer for a single ipython notebook. It is
intended for applications build with ipywidgets. At the moment, it only
works on Windows, but there are plans to address cross-platform support.

1. Builds and packages a minimal electron interface to navigate to
   ``localhost:8866`` and boot up the ``voila`` server
2. Copies a notebook (specified by ``-f``) into a template python
   package
3. Copies the entire contents of the built electron application into the
   template python package.
4. Optionally copies a source code directory (specified by ``-src``), if
   provided, into the template python package.

   -  The package specifies ``**`` for package_data so be sure to clean
      out any ``__pycache__`` folders and other garbage.
   -  Must be a valid python package (i.e. the folder must contain
      ``__init__.py``)

5. Makes a conda-package out of the python package template to hold the
   notebook, electron app, and source code if provided.
6. Builds an installer

   -  Conda dependencies are specified with the ``-deps`` parameter (see
      example).

Usage
-----

.. code:: bash

   mamba install boa constructor nsis nodejs -c conda-forge
   pip install widgetron
   cd examples
   widgetron -h
   widgetron -f=my_notebook.ipynb -src=my_package --icon=icon.ico

Help
----

.. code:: bash

   widgetron -h

::

   usage: widgetron [-h] -f FILE [-deps DEPENDENCIES [DEPENDENCIES ...]] [-p PORT] [-n NAME] [-o OUTDIR] [-v VERSION]
                    [-env CONDA_PREFIX] [-src PYTHON_SOURCE_DIR] [--icon ICON]

   Creates an electron app for displaying the output cells of an interactive notebook.

   options:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -f FILE, --file FILE  Path to notebook to convert. (must be .ipynb)
     -deps DEPENDENCIES [DEPENDENCIES ...], --dependencies DEPENDENCIES [DEPENDENCIES ...]
                           List of conda-forge packages required to run the widget (pip packages are not supported).
     -c CHANNELS [CHANNELS ...], --channels CHANNELS [CHANNELS ...]
                           List of conda channels required to find specified packages. Order is obeyed. Any specified
                           channels are followed by local and conda-forge (so don't add either of those)
     -p PORT, --port PORT  4-digit port number on which the notebook will be hosted.
     -n NAME, --name NAME  Name of the application (defaults to the notebook name).
     -o OUTDIR, --outdir OUTDIR
                           Output directory.
     -v VERSION, --version VERSION
                           App version number.
     -src PYTHON_SOURCE_DIR, --python_source_dir PYTHON_SOURCE_DIR
                           Use with caution. This is a shortcut to avoid needing to build a conda package for your source
                           code. Widgetron is basically a big jinja template, if your notebook has `from my_package
                           import my_widget` then you would pass C:/path/to/my_package, and the directory will by copied
                           recursively into a package shell immediately next to the notebook.
     --icon ICON           Icon for app.

   example usage: widgetron -f=my_notebook.ipynb

TODO
----

-  Test on mac and linux
-  Hide menu bar. It does nothing
-  Taskbar icon is not correct (uses default electron icon)
-  Quit ``voila`` programatically

   -  ``voila`` is launched on
      `main.js#L8 <https://github.com/JoelStansbury/widgetron/blob/main/src/widgetron/templates/electron/main.js#L8>`__.
      It seems to disconnect ``voila`` from the spawned process somehow,
      so it’s proving difficult to kill.

-  Clean up metadata propagation.
-  Allow multiple ``-src`` directories
-  Investigate the possibility to bundle multiple notebooks (I think I
   saw somewhere that ``voila`` can host more than one)
-  Upload to pypi and conda-forge
-  Better page loading

   -  I only saw this once during development, but ``index.html``
      redirected to ``localhost:8866`` before ``voila`` finished booting
      up and the app was unresponsive.

Results

After the ``widgetron`` command the installer is placed in the current
working directory
